That Trabuco Hills team, now ranked No. 3, will try to win its first state title against No. 4 Buchanan, winner of three of the last four titles, and No. 11 Santiago (Corona), the reigning champion. 

At stake are state bragging rights and loads of potential to take down the Woodward Park team record. 

Buchanan, which dominated on its home course at the Clovis Invitational, and dominated against last week at the Central Sectional finals, has a pair of standout freshmen who are still exploring their limits: Gaby Gutierrez and Brooklyn Buckley were the team's top two last weekend. But the team's outstanding depth with Molly Sundgren, Kynzlee Buckley, Sierra Cornett and Avery Hutchison could be what carries the day. 

Santiago (Corona), which features not only Woodbridge Cross Country Classic winner and record-breaker Blade but also Braelyn Combe, is seeking to bounce back from its lopsided loss (75-159) to Trabuco Hills last weekend.

Trabuco Hills was the lone powerhouse to skip the Clovis Invitational, so the matchup with Buchanan is all the more intriguing. 

Last year, Blade beat Barker by 17 seconds to capture the D1 girls individual title. 

In Division 2, Ventura senior Sadie Engelhardt will leave her final and lasting imprint on the CIF cross country finals as she attempts to win a third state championship. That's never happened before in Division 2. 

Engelhardt broke Claudia Lane's Woodward Park course record at the Clovis Invite when she ran 16:24.2. She defeated Blade that day by seven seconds.
